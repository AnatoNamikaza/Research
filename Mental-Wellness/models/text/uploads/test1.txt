I’m having one of those days where I feel both happy and frustrated. The sun is shining, and I can’t help but smile—it feels like everything is going right. But then, out of nowhere, little things start to annoy me. I’m angry at the small disruptions, the careless comments that ruin my mood. It’s like happiness and anger are fighting for my attention today.
