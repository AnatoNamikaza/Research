# REX: The Self-Navigating AI-based Quadruped Robot

### Project Overview
**REX** is a cost-effective quadruped robot developed to tackle versatile applications. It leverages servo motors, sonar sensors, and 3D-printed components to achieve autonomous navigation across challenging terrains. With the integration of **YOLO technology** for object detection and **cloud computing** for data processing, REX can effectively map environments and make real-time decisions for path optimization. This makes it suitable for tasks such as:
- Search and rescue missions
- Exploration of remote areas
- Military reconnaissance

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses sonar sensors and real-time object detection via YOLO to navigate.
- **Adaptable Movements**: The robotic quadruped is designed to adjust its walking pattern based on sensory input from the environment.
- **3D-Printed Design**: All mechanical components are designed to be affordable and easily replaceable, thanks to 3D printing.
- **Servo Motor-Driven Legs**: Precise control over each leg using servo motors enables smooth movement and agility over rough terrain.
- **Cloud Integration**: Powered by cloud computing, allowing REX to offload intensive tasks like environment mapping and path optimization.
