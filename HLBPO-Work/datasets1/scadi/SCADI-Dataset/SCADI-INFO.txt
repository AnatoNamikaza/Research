Data Set Information:

This dataset contains 206 attributes of 70 children with physical and motor disability based on ICF-CY. 
In particular, the SCADI dataset is the only one that has been used by ML researchers for self-care problems classification based on ICF-CY to this date. 
The "Class" field refers to the presence of the self-care problems of the children with physical and motor disabilities.The classes are determined by occupational therapists.
The names and social security numbers of the children were recently removed from the dataset. 

Two files have been "processed", SCADI.arff for using in WEKA and SCADI.CSV for using in MATLAB and similar tools.
