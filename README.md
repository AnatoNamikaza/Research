## Introduction

Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to solving complex problems that are computationally infeasible for classical computers. Qiskit is a powerful open-source quantum computing framework that enables developers to work with quantum circuits and algorithms. LLVM, on the other hand, is a versatile compiler infrastructure that can be used to optimize code for various architectures.

The goal of this project is to combine the strengths of both Qiskit and LLVM to create a more optimized and efficient language for quantum programming. By leveraging LLVM's compilation and optimization capabilities, we can potentially unlock significant performance improvements in quantum algorithms.
